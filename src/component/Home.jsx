                    <h3>ALWAYS ON TIME</h3>
                    <p>
                      As there are only 24 hours a day, having to deal with a plumbing/heating problem is
                      already troublesome enough but sometimes you might have to take time off your work or
                      you might even have plans to tend to on your hectic schedule. At Impetus Plumbing and
                      Heating, we value and respect your time. In doing so, we make sure that we are always on time.
                      We offer a 1-hour time frame to show up at your door. Before we show up at any job, we will
                      confirm with our customers via phone call that we are on our way and the approximate time
                      we will show up within that hour. If we do not give a confirmation or we are late within the
                      1-hour time frame *without giving notification*, we will take 15% off your bill for your time.
                      This is to ensure and show our customers that we deeply value and respect their time.
